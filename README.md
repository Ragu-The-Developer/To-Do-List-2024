**How the Project Works **

1) Here firstly the task should be typed by user and the task prioritize level can be selected before adding the task list

2) The list of tasks will be displayed in the colors where the prioritize level takes place
   for example:
       green - Low Prioritized Task
       Cyan - Medium Prioritized Task
       Red - High Prioritized Task

3) Depends on the Level of task the colors will be displayed with each task list. and also one can mark the list as complete when it is done as there
   is a button 'mark' will be given where each tasks gets marked when we click on it.

4) Then We can export the task list in the PDF which will be downloaded as text format also additionally
   one can export the task list with status level. for example : if we mark complete the task will be exported as task name ( completed )
   while incomplete task will be marked as task name ( incomplete ).
